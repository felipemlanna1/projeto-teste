- PR URL: https://github.com/felipemlanna1/projeto-teste/pull/4
- Branch: pipeline/TESTE-3
- Repo: felipemlanna1/projeto-teste

## CI Jobs

| Job | Status | Duration | Notes |
|-----|--------|----------|-------|
| N/A | N/A | - | No CI checks configured on repository |

## CI Overall: N/A

**Reason**: No CI checks are configured on the repository. The `gh pr checks` command returned "no checks reported on the 'pipeline/TESTE-3' branch", and the `statusCheckRollup` is empty. This is a normal state for a repository without CI/CD pipelines configured.

## Combined Status: PASS

**Summary**: Since no CI is configured, this does not block the pipeline quality gate. Per pipeline rules, N/A status = does not block = PASS for the gate.
